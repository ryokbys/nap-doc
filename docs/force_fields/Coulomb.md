# Coulomb potential (Ewald or short/screend)

Coulomb potential requires a parameter file `in.params.Coulomb`.
Parameters required in the file are different depending on `charges` and `terms` entries.

## Fixed charges given in the input

The basic format (fixed charges to be specified) of `in.params.Coulomb` is the following,

    charges  fixed
      Si   1.0
      O   -2.0
    interactions
      Si  Si
      Si  O
      O   O
    terms  short

    sigma  2.5

In this format, black lines are neglected. There are some keywords:

- `charges` : `fixed` or `variable` (or `qeq`) -- Followed by the lines of species charges, e.g., $q_1 = 1.0$ and $q_2 = -2.0$.
- `interactions` *(optional)* -- Followed by the pairs of species. If not specified, all the  interactions are taken into account.
- `terms` : `full`, `long` or `short`/`screened_cut` -- Either full Ewald terms, long-range term only, short-range term only, or short-term with smooth cutoff.
- `sigma` -- Width of the Gaussian charge distribution, which is related to the
  accuracy in case of Ewald method.

## Fixed charges computed assuming charge neutrality

If `charges  fixed_bvs` is given, the charges on species are computed using their formal charges and principal quantum numbers
as given by Adams and Rao[^Adams2011].
For example, the following `in.params.Coulomb` file is for Li-La-Zr-O system with species charges computed using their approach.

    terms   screened_cut
    charges   fixed_bvs 
       O       -2.0   0.66    2
       Li       1.0   1.28    2
       La       3.0   2.07    6
       Zr       4.0   1.75    5
    
    fbvs   1.000
    
    interactions 
       O   O
       Li  Li
       Li  La
       Li  Zr
       La  La
       La  Zr
       Zr  Zr

The meanings of entries in the four lines just below the `charges` entry are in the order:

1. species
2. formal charge
3. ionic radius used below to determine 
4. principal quantum number

And `fbvs` is $f$ parameter for $r_\mathrm{AB} = f\times (r_\mathrm{A} +r_\mathrm{B})$, which is the distance parameter between species A and B used in complementary error function in screened Coulomb potential as,

$$\phi_\mathrm{AB}(r_{ij}) = k\frac{q_i q_j}{r_{ij}} \mathrm{erfc} \left( \frac{r_{ij}}{r_\mathrm{AB}}\right)$$

The paper[^RK2020] describes how to optimize the ionic radii parameters, where all the principal quantum numbers are set to 1 in order to use formal charges for species.

## Variable charge or QEq

Coulomb potential can treat **variable charge** or **QEq** by specifying
`variable` or `qeq` to the `charges` keyword as shown below.

    charges  variable
      Si  4.7695    8.7893    0.0   0.0  2.4
      O   7.5405    15.8067   0.0  -1.2  0.0
    interactions
      Si  Si
      Si  O
      O   O
    terms  short
    sigma  2.5
    conv_eps  1.0d-6

Here, `charges variable` requires some following lines that have

    name,  chi,  Jii,  E0,  qlow,  qup

-   `name`: name of the chemical species
-   `chi`: electronegativity of the species (eV)
-   `Jii`: hardness of the species (eV)
-   `E0`: atomic energy (eV)
-   `qlow`: lower limit of the charge of the species
-   `qup`: upper limit of the charge of the species
-   `conv_eps`: Convergence criterion of the charge optimization. Usually it should
    be very small to achieve good energy conservation.
